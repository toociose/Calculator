Decided to end the year off doing something I've always wanted to do, which is make an app. 
This first one is super simple in idea, albeit kind of tedious in practice.
However, I am excited to one day make a quality game that will overthrow the charts of the playstore. :D

Added the majority of the buttons required for a 4 function calculator. I just need to create the logic for the 4 functions now. 
Once I recognize how to save the id of whatever button is pressed i can make my operation methods. I think if I make it so if when an operation button is pressed, it checks the value of total, and then waits for the next button to be pressed or something. Idk how you wait for an action as of now.

Equate button is going to parse the string of numbers based upon the operation symbol pressed, then it will split the two numbers based on the index of the operation in the string of numbers. I need to then calculate the two numbers based upon the symbol character chosen.

Realized I need distinctive String and Int variables for both numbers separated by the operand of the users choice. This way, I don't have to look through the entire operation string, and can immediately pull the numbers out to be solved. However, I'm going to have to do this for every number, and its beginning to look like a lot of repetitive code.

Add Button works completely for all numbers, i just need to set up the conditions for the other operations, which I think is not going to be as bad as figuring out how to format
the addition logic.

Finished the main logic to the app for 4 functions, addition,subtraction,multiplication, and division. I just need to add a second orientation mode, but the main app is good for release.

Things I learned: 
I realized the many sub-steps necessary to create an app, even before beginning to code. 
I also realized how important it is to setup an image of what you want your app to look like, and the
limitations involved with that design choice. The most important thing I learned is that making apps for multiple devices is 
something I need to understand. While working on this project I realized that my personal phone(Galaxy S7) showed the app differently than 
the demo phone I was using in Android Studio, which led me to realize there must be a way to make the app look correct on all devices.
That revelation has given me new interest in the development of my next application.
